# Puppy Adoption App

[![Check](https://github.com/mattukouta/PuppyAdoptionApp/actions/workflows/Check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mattukouta/PuppyAdoptionApp/actions/workflows/Check.yaml)

## :scroll: Description
An application for finding your favorite pet.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Created with reference to the [Jetpack Compose sample application](https://github.com/android/compose-samples).
I didn't devise a lot of design, but I made the image as easy to see as possible in consideration of the user to look for, and created a list screen that displays the minimum amount of information.
It's not what it looks like, but I introduced Dagger Hilt and displayed the image by URL.
